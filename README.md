<p>Most horror geeks have no doubt enjoyed the [REC] vs. [REC] 2 debate, and the best thing about arguments like this is that neither side is wrong. The first film deserves credit for delivering such a unique and fascinating piece of horror cinema that combines found footage, bio-horror, and claustrophobic, "zombie"-style mayhem. The sequel deserves even more for expanding the conceit and being even scarier than its predecessor. The later sequels are not half-bad, nor is the American remake, Quarantine, but nothing comes close to the one-two punch of [REC] and [REC] 2. If you've never seen these two films, I envy you.</p>

<p>Movies that tap into a "universal fear" scare the hardest. Neil Marshall, the director behind a few of your favorite Game of Thrones episodes, chose claustrophobia in his spelunking-gone-wrong horror movie, The Descent. If a suffocating location and dimly lit shooting style weren't creepy enough, The Descent boasts some supremely nasty monsters who live deep beneath the surface. When they discover a welcome new food source in a foolhardy group of women, hell breaks loose. Weirdly enough, the scariest scene doesn't even involve the creatures; just a very narrow squeeze between two caverns..</p>

<p>Those who read the Scott Smith novel of the same name simply had to wonder, "How the hell are they going to make killer vines scary?" Then they saw the movie. The Ruins follows a bunch of naive Americans who (very stupidly) decide to explore a Mexican ruin full of murderous foliage. And if you don't think "murderous vines" sounds like a scary concept, just wait until you've experienced the horrific ways in which these biological predators get under their victims' skin. (Kudos to the special effects team -- yikes!) Forced to choose a horrific moment from this grim, gruesome gore-fest's many, many, many horrific moments, I'd probably choose the amputation scene. That one will give you nightmares. Good nightmares.</p>
